<h2>My Top 5 Scenarios</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Scammers</h3>
<p>After landing in Los Santos, Frank and Vedad "Uncle V" made their debut in low level crime, by scamming various citizens in a variety of ways. One of which involved the buying and selling of "art" at a reasonable price, vs the fictional character they both created that would buy it at a much lower price. Acting as the middle men, they would then go on to sell the art at a much higher price. With this capital, they then decided to fund wars between rival gangs acting as a go to for supplies and weaponry, without each of the rival gangs knowing they where both funded by both Frank and V.

<h3>The Wedding</h3>
<p>After cementing themselves as a successful group of scammers, and the go to for drug supplies in the city, the time to pull off "The big one" was on the cards.Frank was informed that his drug operation was under surveillance by several departments within the LSPD. The group needed to find a way to give the authorities enough product to suffice their search, and arrest Frank. The thought process was simple, give them enough to charge with, and end their investigation, whilst protecting the rest of the drug operation, Of course both Frank and Uncle V where not happy with the loss of their product, and also needed to find a way for outside alliances to not be able to interfere with the plan. A WEDDING.<br> Frank and Uncle V decided to host a wedding inviting all the citizens to come along, paying homage to the group. The security for the event would be the lead members of the investigation, thus placing them in the right position to arrest Frank, and also remove weaponry from other allying gang members, who could disrupt the plan. The money tribute by the guests, was enough to cover the groups losses from the framed drug bust, and resulted in the drug investigation being resolved with Frank's apprehension. The LSPD was rewarded with the the largest drugs bust the city has ever seen to date.     
</p> Frank was charged accordingly...

<h3>The creation of Pussy Boys (later called PBC)</h3>
<p>Referred to as "PB" and later "PBC", PBC became one of the cities most loved and memorable gangs, boasting a roster of talented, smart, and highly influential members. Frank and Uncle V had ambitions to dive further into the criminal world, and with the help from much loved criminal mastermind "Moses" the trio decided to create a gang that would enhance their drug profits, and allow them to grow their presence within the city. But to do this they knew they needed a legal front and ambitious members that would be influential to the groups success. Within a short span of time, the gang had over 12 members, with the likes of UWU workers, Jayes Auto employee's, art dealers, racers, giving the group a very sizeable network reach within the city.    </p>

<h3>#MLF</h3>
<p>When Uncle V, Frank and Moses submitted a request to manage Triad Records, the current owner "Mr. F" tasked the trio to sign 3 NEW artists and release some new material, promoting both the record label and the city. Feeling inspired to "bodge" the numbers, Frank and Moses became new artists, and quickly started to make records. One such track also featured the vocals of "Moses Saint Peterson", "Uncle V" and Frank, the record #MANLIKEFRANK became Triad Records first release. The record is still loved by the City of LS and the community of Cloude to this day.   </p>

<h3> Burning Down UWU</h3>
<p>Frank burned down Uwu Cafe as a result of a cooking "incident". After Both Frank and his long term criminal partner Vedad "Uncle V" attempted to batch cook food for their first shift at UWU Cafe, Frank and "V" decided to review the lengthy cooking processes, by setting fire to the kitchen of UWU resulting in a smoother and faster service...    </p>
